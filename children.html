            <h2>Make a difference</h2>
              <p>
                There are over 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system, many of which have entered with little to no possessions. Many have suffered the effects of poverty, neglect, and even abuse. Studies show that for many foster children, these challenges are just beginning.You donâ€™t have to work in child welfare or be a parent to help children in foster care.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are lots of ways to put your valuable abilities to work for raising awareness and advocating on behalf of waiting children. Donate to FriendFoster today to make a difference for foster children now and for years to come.
